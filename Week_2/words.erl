% 1. the results of occuring in lines are not group into tuples. there are only the list of lines, where some word occurs. Like this
% { "foo" , [3,4,5,7,11,12,13] }
% 2. Not sorting the output so that the words occur in lexicographic order.
% 3. Normalising so that common endings, plurals etc. identified.
